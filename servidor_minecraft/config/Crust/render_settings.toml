# Options for Crust's block entity bounding box renderer.

  # If true, block entities close to the player that support Crust's bounding box outline rendering will draw their
  #   boxes if 'show entity hitboxes' is active. This is primarily a debug feature.
  # <Boolean> Valid Values: { true, false }, Default: true
  block_entity_BB_rendering.enabled = true

  # If block entity bounding box rendering is enabled, this value determines the 'radius' in chunks around the player
  #   in which Crust will look for block entities to render bounding boxes for. A value of 1 means only the chunk the
  #   player is standing in. This value is also capped by the effective render distance.
  # <Integer> Range: â‰¥ 1, Default: 3
  block_entity_BB_rendering.distance = 3
