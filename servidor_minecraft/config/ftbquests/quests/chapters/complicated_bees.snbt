				"Some species of &6bee&r, when bred with others, will result in a brand-new species of &6bee&r! Generally these &6bees&r show as hybrids with one of the parent species, but occasionally you might get lucky and find a purebred mutation."

				"When an offspring &amutates&r, one whole chromosome (half of a &6bees&r genetic structure) is completely replaced with the result species' 'pure' chromosome.
