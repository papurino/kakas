//NOTE FOR PEOPLE UPGRADING VERSION: If you are updating your server from an old version, please remember to not copy the new mods into your old folder. Instead you need to REPLACE the old mods folder.
Otherwise you will get mismatched mod issues. So simply delete the mods folder and then paste in the new mods folder, thank you//
